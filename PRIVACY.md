# Privacy Policy for Foxlate

**Last Updated: 2024-05-16**

Foxlate respects your privacy. As an open-source extension, its code is available for review on [GitHub](https://github.com/sanniou/foxlate).

## 1. Data Handling: What We Do & Don't

### We DO NOT:

*   Collect, store, or transmit your translated text, personal information, IP address, browsing history, API keys, or endpoints.
*   Have access to any data processed by the extension.

### We DO:

*   Store your chosen translation engine, API keys (if required by the engine), preferences (target language, display mode, rules), and translation cache locally in your browser.
*   Send the text you select for translation directly to the third-party translation service you configure.

### Key takeaways:

*   Your translation data and personal information remain private.
*   Foxlate only interacts with translation services you explicitly choose.

## 2. Local Data Storage

Foxlate uses your browser's storage to save settings. This data, including API keys, remains on your device and may be synced across your devices by your browser (not by us). You can clear the translation cache in the extension's settings.

### Key takeaway:

*   Your settings are stored securely by your browser and never accessed by us.

---

## 3. Data Sent to Translation Services

When you translate text, Foxlate sends it to the API of the service you've configured (e.g., DeepLx, Google Translate). We don't provide translation services; you control the choice. Your data is subject to the privacy policy of that service.

### Key takeaway:

*   You have full control over which translation service is used.

## 4. Browser Permissions

Foxlate requires these permissions:

*   **`storage`**: Save settings and cache.
*   **`scripting` & `host_permissions: ["<all_urls>"]`**: Inject code for translation, display results, and connect to translation APIs you specify.
*   **`contextMenus`**: Add "Translate with Foxlate" to the right-click menu.
*   **`webNavigation`**: Enable automatic translation and subtitle features on websites you configure.

### Key takeaway:

*   Permissions are used solely to provide translation features.
